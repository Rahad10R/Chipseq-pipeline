#This repository demonstrates a Simple ChIP-Seq analysis workflow done based on model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The downstream analysis of the workflow can vary based on the experiment conducted in lab. Here our aim was to study the relation of  certain proteins
involved in the DSB formation during Meiosis.
